# Progress

The KPI notification feature has been successfully implemented.

- **What Works**:
  - Users can enable/disable KPI alerts, set a minimum request count, and specify a notification time in the settings panel.
  - Settings are now saved using `chrome.storage.local`, making them accessible to the background service worker.
  - A `chrome.alarm` is scheduled to trigger daily at the user-defined time.
  - When the alarm fires, the background script checks the user's request count against the KPI.
  - A system notification is displayed if the KPI is not met.

- **What's Left to Build**:
  - The core functionality is complete. Further enhancements could include more detailed notification content or snooze options.

- **Known Issues**:
  - None at this time. The feature needs to be tested in a real environment to confirm its reliability.
