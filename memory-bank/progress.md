# Progress

The memory bank is now fully updated. I have completed the analysis of the application's main components, including `DashboardTab`, `EmployeeTab`, and `ProjectTab`. This has provided a comprehensive understanding of the application's architecture, data flow, and functionality. Key findings about data management patterns (API vs. `localStorage`) have been documented in `systemPatterns.md`. The project's current state is well-documented, and I am ready for the next set of tasks.
