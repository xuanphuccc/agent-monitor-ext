I have completed a detailed analysis of the core tab components: `DashboardTab`, `EmployeeTab`, and `ProjectTab`.

- `DashboardTab` fetches and displays summary data from a remote API.
- `EmployeeTab` and `ProjectTab` handle CRUD operations for their respective domains, persisting data to `localStorage`.

The `systemPatterns.md` file has been updated to reflect these findings. The memory bank is now up-to-date with the application's current architecture and data management patterns. The next step is to wait for further instructions.
